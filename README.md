The Gas Slot Booking App allows users to view gas providers, book delivery slots, and manage their bookings. It includes features for secure user authentication, slot management, and payment processing.

Summary : Essential steps to build a Gas Slot Booking App:

Design: Create wireframes for the UI and use Bootstrap for responsive design. Frontend: Build React components with Formik for forms and Redux or Context API for state management. Backend: Use Node.js with Express for RESTful APIs, MongoDB for data storage, and implement JWT for authentication. Payment: Integrate Stripe or Razorpay for secure payment processing. This structure should provide a solid foundation for building a comprehensive gas slot booking system. Adjust and expand upon these components and features based on specific project requirements and user needs.
